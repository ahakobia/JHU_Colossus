The rates are age-standardized.  Following diseases are taken into account: acute respiratory infections (estimated for all ages); cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years); ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).","World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory Data Repository (http://apps.who.int/ghodata/).",Health: Mortality,Annual,Weighted average,"Burden of disease (or in the present case attributable mortality) is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g.  the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed). This allows calculation of the 'population attributable fraction' (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed  to the exposure (e.g in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter). Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient air pollution). To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).","Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental risks to health.  According to the World Health Organization, the combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about 7 million premature deaths every year.  Most deaths occur due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.  The majority of the burden is borne by populations in low and middle income countries.","Estimates of the joint effects of air pollution are constrained by limited knowledge on the distribution of the population exposed to both household and ambient air pollution, correlation of exposures at individual level as household air pollution is a contributor to ambient air pollution, and non-linear interactions",This is the Sustainable Development Goal indicator 3.9.1 [https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/].,,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

Estimates of neonatal, infant, and child mortality tend to vary by source and method for a given time and place.

To evaluate health systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that key components - such as financing, service delivery, workforce, governance, and information - be monitored using several key indicators. The data are a subset of the key indicators. Monitoring health systems allows the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of different health system models to be compared.
